## TO-DO


- Use a sample parameter for test purposes (retreive only 3.000 tweets not an unpredictable amount of tweets),
- Write a wrapper for search queries (from, hashtags, filters like: has attachment, has poll and so on),
- Write some convenience functions to retrieve tidy data-frames for standard purposes.
